      "Your essay presents a clear argument in favor of interviews as the most reliable method for recruiting employees. You've effectively highlighted the advantages of this approach, such as assessing a candidate's personality traits, problem-solving abilities, and communication skills. However, there are a few areas where you can improve your argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Supporting evidence**: While you've mentioned that interviews allow recruiters to assess a candidate's potential, it would be helpful to include specific examples or studies that support this claim. Adding data or real-life examples can strengthen your argument and make it more persuasive.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Address counterarguments**: To further strengthen your argument, consider addressing potential counterarguments. For instance, you could discuss how other methods like CVs or cover letters can still provide valuable information and how combining different methods might be more effective than relying solely on interviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Organization**: Your essay is well-structured, but you could improve the flow of your argument by connecting your points more explicitly. For example, after discussing the benefits of interviews, you could briefly mention the limitations of other methods and then transition back to the strengths of interviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion effectively summarizes your main points, but it could be more impactful by reiterating the importance of interviews in the hiring process and perhaps suggesting areas for future research or improvements.\n",
      "Overall, your essay presents a strong case for the reliability of interviews in the recruitment process. With some additional evidence, addressing counterarguments, and refining the organization and conclusion, your argument will be even more compelling.\n",

    "question = \"\"\"Question: Interviews form the basic criteria for most large companies. However, some people think that the interview is not a reliable method of choosing whom to employ and there are other better methods. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Essay: It is believed by some experts that the traditional approach of recruiting candidates which is interviewing is the best way, whereas others think different methods such as exams writing, CVs, cover letters or application letters and many more are good. I strongly agree with the statement, \"interview is the most reliable approach to recruit workers\" because this method assists the recruiters to know the person and his ability to do the work and their problem-solving abilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, an interview enables the  recruiter to know the kind of person he or she is recruiting. It helps the employer to see the personality traits of the employee such as how he answers questions, his facial mannerisms and also his communication skills, that is, whether introvert or extrovert, also his teamwork skill is measured during the dialogue. For instance, jobs like sales personnel require good communication skills to be able to do the work effectively and efficiently. So interviews allow the manager to assess whether or not the applicant qualifies for the job. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, recruiters also assess the applicant's ability to solve problems when they arise. A good idea generated or how one handles situations can bring great development to the company. For instance, pressure can put fear into an employee which can make him make a wrong decision that can bring loss to the company, while some too can take pressure in a calm action and make a good decision. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, other methods such as CVs, cover letters, the use of only certificates and many more are not a suitable step to recruit an applicant due to the fact that it does not allow the recruiter to see the full potential of the candidate. Information found in the CV or cover letter may not be true because people lie to obtain what they desire. In the same way, a candidate can also lie to acquire the position. \n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, I think an interview is still the most reliable practice of hiring employees rather than using other methods. So I suggest managers use only interviews as a means of sourcing workers for their companies. 请帮我的这一片作文打分\"\"\"\n",
